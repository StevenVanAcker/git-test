This repo exists to test some problems with git submodules experienced during autobuild of the OverTheWire games.

The setup is as follows:
- a main repository MAIN like this one 
- a submodule SUB in the main repository, containing for instance the sourcecode of a game

The MAIN repository is used in a development environment to work on the OverTheWire setup.
The same repository is also fetched (in readonly mode) on a production server.

The normal workflow for updating (e.g. fixing a bug) the source code of a game, is:
- fix the code in SUB on the development setup and test whether it works
- git commit the fix to the SUB repo, and push the commit
- git commit the changed submodule reference in MAIN on the development environment, and push the commit

At this point, the autobuild script will notice that the MAIN repository has changed and that
it needs to build the games in the production setup. It uses this workflow:
- git pull of the MAIN repo
- ??? some magic here
- build the games in each changed SUB repository

It turns out that simply doing "git pull" is not sufficient on the MAIN repository, because
the submodule does not automatically update. For instance, after a "git pull" on MAIN,
the SUB repo status is "HEAD detached at 12345678", where 12345678 is the last commit
the SUB repo was at before the changes were pushed from the development environment.
